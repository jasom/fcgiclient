A simple fastcgi client (i.e. what goes on the server side)

I created this mainly to allow connecting legacy FastCGI apps to mongrel2.

It should be useful for connecting just about any application server  wiht a
lisp backend to FastCGI (e.g. hunchentoot).  Although why one would want to do
that is beyond me.
